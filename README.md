Foodie By Nature
================

This repository is a personnal training project to learn the Symfony framework and its ecosystem (Doctrine, Bundles, PHPUnit, Composer, Git...). It is also the basis of a website dedicated to natural wines :

 * find and review about places where you can eat and drink great natural wines
 * learn about natural winemakers
 * find shops
 * be aware of events
 * read tutorials

Come on and make a great website for all natural wines lovers!

Developed with love when I have time. For us, by us.

### Installation

** Note : The actual Symfony version is 2.8.x. There are still some deprecated lines of code to be modified before it is possible to upgrade to 3.x versions.**

 * **Clone the repository**

`git clone https://github.com/CruzyCruz/FoodieByNature`

 * **Install dependencies**

Browse to */path/to/FoodieByNature* and run

 `composer update`

*Note :* the `composer.lock` file is only used to keep dependencies version history.

When running this command, you will get the following error:

>Package egeloen/http-adapter is abandoned, you should avoid using it. Use php-http/httplug instead

This is because the package [`willdurand/geocoder-bundle 4.x`](https://github.com/geocoder-php/BazingaGeocoderBundle/blob/master/composer.json) uses [`willdurand/geocoder 3.x`](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder/tree/3.x) that uses [`egeloen/http-adapter`](https://github.com/egeloen/ivory-http-adapter) which is deprecated. This will be solved with the next major version of `willdurand/geocoder`. At this time time it is not really a problem as you can read [here](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder/issues/548#issuecomment-276022571).

* **Create parameters file**

Copy *app/config/parameters.yml.dist* content in *app/config/parameters.yml* (generated by composer during dependencies installation).

* **Configure database**

This configuration is for a MySQL databe but conigure it to match your needs. See [here](http://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#configuring-the-database) for official documentation.

```yml
parameters:
	database_driver: pdo_mysql
	database_host: 127.0.0.1
	database_port: null
	database_name: fbn
	database_user: your_database_username
	database_password: your_database_password
```

* **Configure swiftmailer**

This configuration is for a Gmail account but configure it to match your needs. See [here](http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/swiftmailer.html) for official documentation.

```yml
parameters:
    mailer_transport: gmail
    mailer_host: 127.0.0.1
    mailer_user: your_username@gmail.com
    mailer_password: your_gmail_password
```

* **Configure the default locale**

By default, the main locale is `en`. That means that, at backend level, you can not translate your content until your have completed and validated your data in this locale. You can change it if you want. At this time two locales are used : `en` and `fr`.

```yml
parameters:
    locale: en
```

* **Choose a secret key**

This is needed for CSRF tokens generation, cookies encryption and signed URIS when using ESI. See [here](http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#secret) for official documentation.

```yml
parameters:
    secret: secret_string
```

* **Configure Oauth account**

The application permits to users to authenticate using Google and Facebook Oauth authentication. For that you need to enter your credentials at application level (see below) and configure the application in Google and Facebook developers consoles. See [here](https://github.com/hwi/HWIOAuthBundle/blob/0.4/Resources/doc/2-configuring_resource_owners.md) for official documentation.

```yml
parameters:
    google_client_id: google_client_id
    google_client_secret: google_client_secret
    fb_client_id: fb_client_id
    fb_client_secret: fb_client_secret
```    

In the Google and Facebook developper console enter the following authorized redirection URIs in your application (dev mode):

`Google`
`http://yourdomain/app_dev.php/fr/login/check-google`
`http://yourdomain/app_dev.php/en/login/check-google`

`Facebook`
`http://yourdomain/app_dev.php/fr/login/check-facebook`
`http://yourdomain/app_dev.php/en/login/check-facebook`

### Database

 * ** Create database **

 `php app/console doctrine:database:create`

 * ** Create schema **

 `php app/console doctrine:schema:create`

 * ** Load fixtures **

 `php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load`

 This can take a little moment (20/30 seconds) as Geocoding is used to fetch some coordinates (longitude, latitude).

 * **Schema (UML)**

You can have an overview of the database schema using [Dia](http://dia-installer.de/index.html). The schema is located in:

`src/FBN/GuideBundle/Resources/doc/fbn.dia`

### Tests

* **Install PHPUnit**

See [here](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html#installation.phar) for official documentation.

* **Run tests**

Browse to */path/to/FoodieByNature* and run

`phpunit -c app`

*Note :* the test database is named `%database_name%_test` (see *app/config/config_test.yml*). Each time you run the tests, cache is cleared and this database is deleted and re-created (or only created the first time) to reflect the last database schema. Then fixtures are loaded.

### Usage

See [here](http://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/web_server_configuration.html) to learn about server configuration.

* **Public website**

Homepage (dev mode) is accessible from the following URIs:

`http://yourdomain/app_dev.php/en/`
`http://yourdomain/app_dev.php/fr/`

* **Admin panel**

Admin panel (dev mode) is accessible from the following URIs:

`http://yourdomain/app_dev.php/en/admin`
`http://yourdomain/app_dev.php/fr/admin`
